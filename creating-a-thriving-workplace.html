The CI CoE Pilot and CI4Resilience project is are hosting a one-day workshop on June 29 for NSF Major Facilities (MFs), on creating a thriving workplace. At the <a href="https://facilitiesci.github.io/2019/">2019 NSF Workshop on Connecting Large Facilities and Cyberinfrastructure</a>, participants working in MFs described needs and challenges with  building and developing staff that we had not heard discussed by those working in more mainstream academic research institutions. To explore this further, the Pilot conducted a series of interviews with managers at MFs to learn more about their experiences with hiring, retention, training and mentoring, work culture, rewards and recognition, and loss of personnel. From these interviews we learned more about how MFs grow and develop their staff, what aspects of their staffing situations appear to be unique to working in an MF, and what aspects tend to resemble more typical academic research institutions. To continue to fulfill our mission of supporting and fostering the work of MFs, we are hosting this workshop to provide a forum for discussion and idea-sharing around professional development  issues specific to MFs.
                </p>

                <p>
The workshop will focus on three main topics:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Working in remote or distributed teams</strong>
                  <li><strong>Working in non-traditional physical environments</strong>
                 <li><strong>Creating a work culture that taps into intrinsic motivations</strong>
                </ul>

                <h2>Who Should Attend</h2>
                <p>
