  <strong>Who:</strong> Attendees will include cybersecurity practitioners, technical leaders, and risk owners from within the NSF Large Facilities and CI Community, as well as key stakeholders and thought leaders from the broader scientific and information security communities.
  <br /><br />
  <strong>Opportunities to Share:</strong> The NSF cyberinfrastructure ecosystem presents an aggregate of complex cybersecurity needs (e.g., scientific data and instruments, unique computational and storage resources, complex collaborations) as compared to other organizations and sectors. This community has a unique opportunity to develop information security practices tailored to these needs, as well as break new ground on efficient, effective ways to protect information assets while supporting science. The Summit will bring together leaders in NSF cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity to continue the process initiated in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 & 2018: Building a trusting, collaborative community, and seriously addressing that community's core cybersecurity challenges.
  <br /><br />
  The Summit seeks proposals for presentations, breakout and training sessions. It offers opportunities for student scholarships.

  If you are interested in presenting at the Summit, please respond to the 2019 Call for Proposals when released. The Summit organizers welcome proposals from all individuals and agencies.
