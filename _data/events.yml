  The workshop is a collaborative forum for the National Science Foundation’s Large Facilities and other complex scientific facilities and organizations. Desired outcomes to support NSF’s mission and promote the scientific endeavor include:
  <ul>
    <li>Provide a forum to collect and share best practices and lessons learned</li>
    <li>Discuss new initiatives and collect community input</li>
    <li>Demonstrate project management, operations, and business-related tools and techniques</li>
    <li>Expand our community of practice by connecting colleagues across disciplines and organizations to promote collaboration between facilities</li>
  </ul>
  Attendance is especially beneficial for those who have a role in the development, planning, construction or operation of large complex scientific facilities. Attendees will have the opportunity to participate in various networking events with their colleagues.

  date: "September 16, 2019 - September 17, 2019"
  venue: "Alexandria, CA"
  description: "
  Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is the fabric of modern science. Large collaborations and individual scientists rely on CI to support the entire data lifecycle from data capture and processing to data storage and archiving and finally to data access, visualization, and dissemination. The Large Facilities (LFs), the biggest scientific investments made by the National Science Foundation, are relying on existing CI and building new CI capabilities and solutions to support their scientific communities.
  <br /><br />
  The NSF Large Facilities Cyberinfrastructure Workshop (LFCI Workshop) found that: \"There is also a lack of a facilities’ CI community that can collectively address CI sustainability and help provide continuity between existing and future facilities.\"
  <br /><br />
  In 2017, the LFCI workshop brought together members of LFs and CI providers and practitioners to discuss possible avenues of collaboration, share common experiences, and discuss common challenges. This workshop aims to continue the discussion started in 2017 and to provide a forum for the cyberinfrastructure experts to share ideas and experiences and discuss the future of CI and the CI workforce.
  <br /><br />
  Goals:
  <ul>
    <li>Identifying common cyberinfrastructure challenges among LFs</li>
    <li>Understanding the LF data lifecycle, including the commonalities and differences between data lifecycle stages</li>
    <li>Exploring opportunities for joint training and education among LFs and large CI projects</li>
    <li>Sharing experiences in CI project management</li>
    <li>Discussing approaches to building a community of CI professionals among others</li>
  </ul>

  date: "October 15, 2019 - October 17, 2019"
  venue: "Catamaran Resort Hotel, San Diego, CA"
  description: "
  <strong>Who:</strong> Attendees will include cybersecurity practitioners, technical leaders, and risk owners from within the NSF Large Facilities and CI Community, as well as key stakeholders and thought leaders from the broader scientific and information security communities.
  <br /><br />
  <strong>Opportunities to Share:</strong> The NSF cyberinfrastructure ecosystem presents an aggregate of complex cybersecurity needs (e.g., scientific data and instruments, unique computational and storage resources, complex collaborations) as compared to other organizations and sectors. This community has a unique opportunity to develop information security practices tailored to these needs, as well as break new ground on efficient, effective ways to protect information assets while supporting science. The Summit will bring together leaders in NSF cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity to continue the process initiated in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 & 2018: Building a trusting, collaborative community, and seriously addressing that community's core cybersecurity challenges.
  <br /><br />
  The Summit seeks proposals for presentations, breakout and training sessions. It offers opportunities for student scholarships.
  <br /><br />
  If you are interested in presenting at the Summit, please respond to the 2019 Call for Proposals when released. The Summit organizers welcome proposals from all individuals and agencies.
