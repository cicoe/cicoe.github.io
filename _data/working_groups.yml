- title: "Identity Management"
  description: "The Identity Management working group focuses on understanding current practice in authentication and authorization, and helping to mature practice across the NSF Major Facilities. We do this by maintaining and sharing awareness of best practices as well as current policy and technology options for implementing those practices. Through direct engagements with specific facilities, participation in the NSF Cybersecurity Summit and other events, and publishing experience papers, case studies, and other artifacts, we hope to accelerate the exchange of lessons learned in Identity Management across the NSF Major Facility ecosystem."

- title: "Data Capture"
  description: "This working group focuses on the multiple technology stacks required and challenges involved in: (i) data capture at the sensor front end, (ii) pre-process data at the edge, (iii) transport of data from sensors to central processing and archive sites, and (iv) deployment & maintenance of large scale remote sensor systems.  The goals of this group are to provide demonstrators and comparisons of the multiple architectures that might be used in accomplishing the above."
