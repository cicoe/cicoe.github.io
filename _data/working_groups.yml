- title: "Identity Management"
  description: "The Identity Management working group focuses on understanding current practice in authentication and authorization, and helping to mature practice across the NSF Major Facilities. We do this by maintaining and sharing awareness of best practices as well as current policy and technology options for implementing those practices. Through direct engagements with specific facilities, participation in the NSF Cybersecurity Summit and other events, and publishing experience papers, case studies, and other artifacts, we hope to accelerate the exchange of lessons learned in Identity Management across the NSF Major Facility ecosystem."

- title: "Major Facility Following"
  description: "This working group aims to gauge if following Major Facilities on their Social Media platforms will result in becoming more in tune with their needs, objectives, and challenges. The working group is actively researching tools for tracking online activity and determining which are most useful. Once the pilot phase has yielded results, the group will pivot to utilizing best practices in order to pin-point possible opportunities for engagement, focusing on the CI CoE Team's expertise and services that they can provide."
