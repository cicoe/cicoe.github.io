  title: "Keynote: Creating a Trained and Motivated User Base for Large Research Facilities
and Their Data"
  description: "Drawing on lessons learned from four decades of use and engagement with
management of the US Academic Research Fleet and other Ocean Science research facilities,
the speaker will advocate for targeted training efforts and programs that help the science
community understand what Large Research Facilities offer, how they are managed and
funded, how they are accessed and scheduled, and the full scope of user responsibilities and
risks. Such training programs can improve workforce retention amongst early career scientists,
and foster collaboration and outreach. A 10-year retrospective will be given on the “UNOLS
Chief Scientist Training Program” that was initiated in 2011 to provide such training to sea-
going oceanographers. Evolving cyber infrastructure tools that may extend to remote facility
users will also be highlighted."

  title: "Remote/Distributed Team Work"
  description: "Many MF staff are spread around the globe and have to find ways to coordinate their activities and collaborate effectively without the benefit of physical proximity. Many work in different time zones, different cultures, and different geopolitical situations--all of which can affect how work is done."

  title: "Non-Traditional Work Settings"
  description: "Many MFs are located in harsh environments (e.g., the Antarctic, around the sites of volcanoes and frequent earthquakes); or require extended work away from home, family, and friends (e.g., aboard ships on the ocean); or are situated in remote locales away from the hustle and bustle of a big city or a buzzing college campus and the opportunities those locales hold. We all spend a lot of time at work and one's physical work environment can impact health and well-being as well as the ability to be productive and achieve goals."

  title: "Creating a work culture that taps into intrinsic motivations"
  description: "In this session participants will learn about the concept of intrinsic motivation and its three building blocks: autonomy, mastery, and purpose, as described by career analyst Daniel H. Pink. In his book, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, Pink argues that the problem-solving needed in the 21st-century workplace will only be achieved by self-directed employees who have opportunities to develop their skills and contribute to something greater than themselves."
