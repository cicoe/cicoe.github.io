  abstract: "The National Science Foundation’s Large Facilities are major, multi-user research facilities that operate and manage sophisticated and diverse research instruments and platforms (e.g., large telescopes, interferometers, distributed sensor arrays) that serve a variety of scientific disciplines, from astronomy and physics to geology and biology and beyond. Large Facilities are increasingly dependent on advanced cyberinfrastructure (i.e., computing, data, and software systems; networking; and associ- ated human capital) to enable the broad delivery and analysis of facility-generated data. These cyberinfrastructure tools enable scientists and the public to gain new insights into fundamental questions about the structure and history of the universe, the world we live in today, and how our environment may change in the coming decades. This paper describes a pilot project that aims to develop a model for a Cyberinfrastructure Center of Excellence (CI CoE) that facilitates community building and knowledge sharing, and that disseminates and applies best practices and innovative solutions for facility CI."

- title: "Exploration of Workflow Management Systems Emerging Features from Users Perspectives"
  abstract: "There has been a recent emergence of new workflowapplications  focused  on  data  analytics  and  machine  learning.This   emergence   has   precipitated   a   change   in   the   workflowmanagement  landscape,  causing  the  development  of  new  data-oriented  workflow  management  systems  (WMSs)  as  opposed  tothe  earlier  standard  of  task-oriented  WMSs.  In  this  paper,  wesummarize  three  general  workflow  use-cases  and  explore  theunique  requirements  of  each  use-case  in  order  to  understandhow   WMSs   from   both   workflow   management   models   (task-driven workflow management models and data-driven workflowmanagement  models)  meet  the  requirements  of  each  workflowuse-case from the user’s perspective. We analyze the applicabilityof  the  two  main  workflow  models  by  carefully  describing  eachmodel and by providing an examination of the different variationsof  WMSs  that  fall  under  the  task-driven  model.  To  illustratethe  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  each  workflow  managementmodel, we summarize the key features of four production-readyWMSs:  Pegasus,  Makeflow,  Apache  Airflow,  and  Pachyderm.Of  these  production-ready  WMSs,  three  belong  to  the  task-driven  workflow  management  model  (i.e.,  Pegasus,  Makeflow,Apache  Airflow)  and  one  belongs  to  the  data-driven  workflowmanagement  model  (i.e.,  Pachyderm).  To  deepen  our  analysisof  the  four  WMSs  examined  in  this  paper,  we  implement  threereal-world  use-cases  to  highlight  the  specifications  and  featuresof  each  WMS.  The  application  of  these  real-world  use-casesdemonstrates  how  each  workflow  management  model  operateswith  the  different  applications.  We  present  our  final  assessmentof  each  WMS  after  considering  the  following  factors:  usability,performance, ease of deployment, and relevance. The purpose ofthis work is to offer insights from the user’s perspective into theresearch challenges that WMSs currently face due to the evolvingworkflow  landscape."
