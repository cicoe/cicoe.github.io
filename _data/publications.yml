  abstract: "National   Science   Foundation’s   major   multi-userresearch  facilities  (Large  Facilities)  are  sophisticated  researchinstruments  and  platforms  –  such  as  large  telescopes,  inter-ferometers  and  distributed  sensor  arrays  –  that  serve  diversescientific  disciplines  from  astronomy  and  physics  to  geoscienceand biological science. Large Facilities are increasingly dependenton  advanced  cyberinfrastructure  (CI)  –  computing,  data  andsoftware  systems,  networking,  and  associated  human  capital  –to enable broad delivery and analysis of facility-generated data.As  a  result  of  these  cyberinfrastructure  tools,  scientists  and  thepublic  gain  new  insights  into  fundamental  questions  about  thestructure and history of the universe, the world we live in today,and  how  our  plants  and  animals  may  change  in  the  comingdecades.  This  paper  describes  a  pilot  project  that  aims  developa  model  for  a  Cyberinfrastructure  Center  of  Excellence  (CICoE) that facilitates community building and sharing and appliesknowledge  of  best  practices  and  innovative  solutions  for  LargeFacility  CI."

- title: "Exploration of Workflow Management Systems Emerging Features from Users Perspectives"
  abstract: "There has been a recent emergence of new workflowapplications  focused  on  data  analytics  and  machine  learning.This   emergence   has   precipitated   a   change   in   the   workflowmanagement  landscape,  causing  the  development  of  new  data-oriented  workflow  management  systems  (WMSs)  as  opposed  tothe  earlier  standard  of  task-oriented  WMSs.  In  this  paper,  wesummarize  three  general  workflow  use-cases  and  explore  theunique  requirements  of  each  use-case  in  order  to  understandhow   WMSs   from   both   workflow   management   models   (task-driven workflow management models and data-driven workflowmanagement  models)  meet  the  requirements  of  each  workflowuse-case from the user’s perspective. We analyze the applicabilityof  the  two  main  workflow  models  by  carefully  describing  eachmodel and by providing an examination of the different variationsof  WMSs  that  fall  under  the  task-driven  model.  To  illustratethe  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  each  workflow  managementmodel, we summarize the key features of four production-readyWMSs:  Pegasus,  Makeflow,  Apache  Airflow,  and  Pachyderm.Of  these  production-ready  WMSs,  three  belong  to  the  task-driven  workflow  management  model  (i.e.,  Pegasus,  Makeflow,Apache  Airflow)  and  one  belongs  to  the  data-driven  workflowmanagement  model  (i.e.,  Pachyderm).  To  deepen  our  analysisof  the  four  WMSs  examined  in  this  paper,  we  implement  threereal-world  use-cases  to  highlight  the  specifications  and  featuresof  each  WMS.  The  application  of  these  real-world  use-casesdemonstrates  how  each  workflow  management  model  operateswith  the  different  applications.  We  present  our  final  assessmentof  each  WMS  after  considering  the  following  factors:  usability,performance, ease of deployment, and relevance. The purpose ofthis work is to offer insights from the user’s perspective into theresearch challenges that WMSs currently face due to the evolvingworkflow  landscape."
