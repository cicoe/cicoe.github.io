                <p><strong>Tuesday June 29th, 2021 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Online via Zoom</strong></p>

                <p>
The CI CoE Pilot is hosting a one-day workshop on June 29, on workforce development issues pertinent to NSF Major Facilities (MFs). At the 2019 NSF Workshop on Connecting Large Facilities and Cyberinfrastructure, participants working in MFs described needs and challenges with workforce development that we had not heard discussed by those working in more mainstream academic research institutions. To explore this further, the Pilot conducted a series of interviews with managers at MFs to learn more about their experiences with hiring, retention, training and mentoring, work culture, rewards and recognition, and loss of personnel. From these interviews we learned more about how MFs grow and develop their workforce, what aspects of their staffing situations appear to be unique to working in an MF, and what aspects tend to resemble more typical academic research institutions. To continue to fulfill our mission of supporting and fostering the work of MFs, we are hosting this workshop to provide a forum for discussion and idea-sharing around workforce development issues specific to MFs.

The workshop will focus on three main topics:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Working in remote or distributed teams</strong><br>
Many MF staff are spread around the globe and have to find ways to coordinate their activities and collaborate effectively without the benefit of physical proximity. Many work in different time zones, different cultures, and different geopolitical situations--all of which can affect how work is done.

                  <li><strong>Working in non-traditional physical environments</strong><br>
Many MFs are located in harsh environments (e.g., the Antarctic, around the sites of volcanoes and frequent earthquakes); or require extended work away from home, family, and friends (e.g., on ships in the ocean); or are situated in remote locales away from the hustle and bustle of a big city or a buzzing college campus and the opportunities those locales hold. We all spend a lot of time at work and oneâ€™s physical work environment can impact health and well being as well as the ability to be productive and achieve goals.

<li><strong>Creating a work culture that taps into intrinsic motivations</strong> to help individuals engage with their work in a way that is personally fulfilling has been shown to be a greater predictor of job performance than typical carrot and stick models. New graduates often seek high-powered, high-paying jobs in big cities working for Google or Amazon. How can MFs capitalize on their assets (e.g., their mission to explore and gain new knowledge) to attract and retain the latest talent?
                </ul>

                <h2>Who Should Attend</h2>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> This workshop is for MF staff at any level--new employee to seasoned manager--who are interested in workforce development and helping their MF achieve its goals in that regard.
                    <li>If you work at partner organizations (e.g., SGCI, TrustedCI) or elsewhere in the MF ecosystem and also have interests in workforce development, this workshop may interest you as well.
                    <li>If you are employed at NSF and work with MFs, or have particular interest in workforce development in large research organizations, then we encourage you to attend as well.
