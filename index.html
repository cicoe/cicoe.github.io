                        The CI CoE had four types of profound influence on NEON developers. First, as we transitioned
                        from construction to operations, our developers benefited from greater awareness of the wider
                        NSF CI community practices. Second, deep engagement with CI CoE experts produced three major
                        technologies insertions into NEON CI, remarkably within 6 months. Third, open dialog and
                        prototyping with CI CoE experts affirmed our workflow-based sensor message handling strategy and
                        built our confidence to invest in this novel method. NEON's CI and Data Sciences team mission
                        includes advancing methods and ecological science; interaction with CI CoE nudged our efforts
                        ahead significantly through community workgroup involvement, presentations and publications.

                        NSF's major multi-user research facilities (major facilities) are sophisticated research
                        instruments and platforms - such as large telescopes, interferometers and distributed sensor
                        arrays - that serve diverse scientific disciplines from astronomy and physics to geoscience and
                        biological science. Major facilities are increasingly dependent on advanced cyberinfrastructure
                        (CI) - computing, data and software systems, networking, and associated human capital - to
                        enable broad delivery and analysis of facility-generated data. As a result of these cyber
                        infrastructure tools, scientists and the public gain new insights into fundamental questions
                        about the structure and history of the universe, the world we live in today, and how our plants
                        and animals may change in the coming decades. The goal of this pilot project is to develop a
                        model for a Cyberinfrastructure Center of Excellence (CI CoE) that facilitates community
                        building and sharing and applies knowledge of best practices and innovative solutions for
                        facility CI.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5em">
                        The pilot project will explore how such a center would facilitate CI improvements for existing
                        facilities and for the design of new facilities that exploit advanced CI architecture designs
                        and leverage establish tools and solutions. The pilot project will also catalyze a key function
                        of an eventual CI CoE - to provide a forum for exchange of experience and knowledge among CI
                        experts. The project will also gather best practices for major facilities, with the aim of
                        enhancing individual facility CI efforts in the broader CI context. The discussion forum and
                        planning effort for a future CI CoE will also address training and workforce development by
                        expanding the pool of skilled facility CI experts and forging career paths for CI professionals.
                        The result of this work will be a strategic plan for a CI CoE that will be evaluated and refined
                        through community interactions: workshops and direct engagement with the facilities and the
                        broader CI community.
